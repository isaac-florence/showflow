Description: Inspired by Apache Airflow and prompted by {targets}, showflow is a flexible package which interprets special,
  {roxygen2}-style comments to create a map of pipelines or processes in R. You can also use drop-in functions to monitor pipeline 
  progression in an external, auxiliary dataset for real-time monitoring.
