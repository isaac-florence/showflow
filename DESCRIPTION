Description: Inspired by Apache Airflow and prompted by {targets}, showflow is a lightweight, flexible package which interprets special,
  {roxygen2}-style comments to create a map of pipelines or processes in R, and drop-in functions to monitor pipeline progression in 
  an external or auxiliary dataset for real-time visualisation and monitoring.
